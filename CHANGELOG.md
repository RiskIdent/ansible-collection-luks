## v0.2.0 (WIP)

- Added support for "check mode". (#12)

- Added field `luks_ssh_private_key` for supplying SSH private key as
  raw string instead of using `luks_ssh_private_key_file`. (#13)

  This is implemented by adding the private key to your ssh-agent. It is by
  default added with the `-t 3600` flag, so the key is automatically removed
  from your ssh-agent after 1 hour.

## v0.1.1 (2022-08-29)

- Added `meta/runtime.yml` (#7)

- Fixed missing quotes in `dropbear_ssh_pub_keys_unlock_options` default SSH
  restriction command in `initramfs_dropbear` role. (#8)

- Added `become: yes` to documentation, as all this collection's roles and
  action plugins need it. (#9)

- Added docs to introduce action plugin and roles to README.md (#11)

## v0.1.0 (2022-08-23)

- Added repository to GitHub, moved from our closed-source internal repo. (#1)
